return "New Cosmetic Option: #LIGHT_GREEN#Bikini and Mankini",
[[You have saved Melinda again at the beach.

You may now create characters that start equiped with either bikini or mankini.
This has no effect on gameplay at all but it is fun!

#{bold}#Also if you never take your bikini/mankini off and manage to win, you will get an achievement!#{normal}#

#LIGHT_GREEN#This is only available to donators. Thanks for your support!
